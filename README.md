# AWS-Athena
### What is Amazon Athena?
Amazon Athena is a serverless, interactive query service provided by AWS that allows users to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries. It eliminates the need to manage infrastructure, such as provisioning, scaling, or maintaining database instances, as Athena automatically handles all underlying compute resources. Queries are executed in parallel, ensuring fast performance even with large datasets. This makes Athena an ideal choice for users new to data analysis who want a simple, cost-effective way to query data without complex setup.

- Athena is an AWS service that allows you to **query data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL**.  
- It supports various data types, including log files, order data, and more.  
- **Serverless**, meaning no need to manage infrastructure—AWS handles compute automatically.  
- Executes queries **in parallel** for fast results.  

### **Why Use Athena?**  
Amazon Athena enables users to query structured or semi-structured data stored in S3, such as log files, order data, or any other dataset, using familiar SQL syntax. The results can be further analyzed or visualized using tools like Amazon QuickSight to create reports and dashboards. Common use cases include:
- Querying AWS service logs, such as CloudWatch logs, VPC Flow Logs, or CloudTrail.
- Performing business intelligence tasks, such as analyzing sales or customer data.
- Conducting analytics on any S3 data where SQL queries are applicable.
- **Query logs** (CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail).  
- **Business intelligence & analytics** (analyze and visualize data with QuickSight).  
- **Any use case where you need SQL queries on S3 data**.  

### Key Features
- _**Serverless:**_ No need to manage database instances; Athena automatically provisions and scales compute resources.
- _**Parallel Query Execution:**_ Queries are processed in parallel for fast performance.
- _**Integration with AWS Glue Data Catalog:**_ Metadata about S3 data is stored in tables and databases within the AWS Glue Data Catalog.
- _**SQL-Based Querying:**_ Supports standard SQL syntax and functions, making it accessible for users familiar with SQL.
- _**Trino SQL Engine:**_ Athena uses the open-source Trino query engine under the hood, but users do not need to interact with Trino directly.
- _**Pay-Per-Use Pricing:**_ Charges are based on the amount of data scanned during queries, with no upfront costs or infrastructure fees.

### **Pricing:**  
Athena operates on a pay-per-use model, charging $5 per terabyte of data scanned during query execution. For small datasets (e.g., kilobytes or megabytes), costs are typically a few cents per query. As a beginner, you can expect minimal costs (e.g., 1-2 cents for small-scale queries), but always monitor usage and clean up resources to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Pay per query**—$5 per terabyte of data scanned.  
- No upfront costs or infrastructure management.

### 3. Create a Table with AWS Glue Crawler

Athena queries **tables**, not raw S3 files. A **crawler** reads your data and creates a table automatically.

#### A. Create a Database

1. Go to **AWS Glue** > **Databases**.
2. Click **Add database**, name it (e.g., `my-first-database`), then **Create**.

#### B. Create a Crawler

1. Go to **Glue** > **Crawlers** > **Create crawler**.
2. Name the crawler (e.g., `my-first-glue-crawler`) > **Next**.
3. **Source type:** Data stores

   * **Data store:** S3
   * Enter path: `s3://files-for-athena-YYYYMMDD/`
   * **Next**
4. **IAM Role:**

   * Choose **Create a new IAM role**, name it (e.g., `AWSGlueServiceRole-Athena`)
   * **Next**
5. **Schedule:** Run on demand > **Next**
6. **Output database:** Select `my-first-database` > **Next**
7. Review and click **Create crawler**
8. Run the crawler.

> 📝 **Check Results:**
> Go to **Tables** in Glue > confirm table (e.g., `files_for_athena`) with correct schema.

### 4. Run Queries in Athena

Now your data is queryable using SQL!

#### Steps:

1. Open **Athena Query Editor**.
2. Select the database (e.g., `my-first-database`).
3. Ensure table (e.g., `files_for_athena`) appears in left panel.

#### Sample Queries:

```sql
-- View sample data
SELECT * FROM files_for_athena LIMIT 10;

-- Top 5 customers by spend
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spend
FROM files_for_athena
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### View Results:

* Click **Download results** in the editor.
* Or go to `s3://athena-results-YYYYMMDD/` to find CSV output files.

> ⚠️ **Tips:**
>
> * Use `WHERE` clauses to reduce scanned data and cost.
> * Athena supports full SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.).

## 🧹 Cleanup Resources

Avoid unwanted charges by deleting everything after you're done:

1. **Delete Athena Table:**

   * Glue > Databases > `my-first-database` > Tables > Delete `files_for_athena`

2. **Delete Glue Database:**

   * Glue > Databases > Delete `my-first-database`

3. **Delete Crawler:**

   * Glue > Crawlers > Delete `my-first-glue-crawler`

4. **Delete S3 Buckets:**

   * Empty each bucket first, then delete:

     * `files-for-athena-YYYYMMDD`
     * `athena-results-YYYYMMDD`

---

## 📘 Additional Notes

* **QuickSight Integration:** Visualize Athena queries in dashboards (advanced).
* **Trino SQL Engine:** Athena uses Trino, but standard SQL is enough for beginners.
* **Permissions Checklist:**

  * `s3:GetObject` for data bucket
  * `s3:PutObject` for results bucket
  * `glue:*` for table/catalog management
  * `athena:*` for running queries
* **CSV File Tips:** Ensure header row exists and format is consistent.
* **Troubleshooting:**

  * Crawler not detecting schema? Check CSV format and permissions.
  * Query errors? Verify table schema and result location config.

  <summary>Click to View the Breakdown of Key Points in All the Services</summary>

### **1. S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)**

Athena works directly with **S3** as the data storage service. All your datasets (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro) are stored in **S3 buckets**. When you query data with Athena, it reads the data directly from these S3 buckets. Athena doesn't store the data itself—**S3 is where the data resides**.

#### Key Points:

* **Storage**: Data is stored in **S3** in the format you prefer.
* **Querying**: Athena uses the **SQL** query engine to read and analyze data directly from S3 files (no data ingestion process is required).
* **Cost**: You pay based on the amount of data scanned by your queries. Using efficient file formats like **Parquet** or **ORC** can reduce costs significantly by minimizing the data scanned.

### **2. AWS Glue (Data Catalog)**

While **S3** is the storage solution, **AWS Glue** helps manage your data schema and metadata, which Athena needs for creating tables and querying data.

* **AWS Glue Data Catalog** acts as the **metadata store** for Athena. It contains the tables, databases, and schema definitions that Athena needs to execute queries.
* **AWS Glue Crawlers** can automatically discover and create metadata for your datasets in S3, making it easier to set up your tables and databases in Athena.

#### Key Points:

* **Metadata Management**: Glue Data Catalog stores metadata about your data in S3.
* **Data Discovery**: The **AWS Glue Crawler** automatically discovers data format and schema from your S3 files and creates tables in the Glue Catalog.
* **Integration**: Athena queries data from S3 using the metadata stored in the Glue Data Catalog. Glue simplifies schema management.

### **3. AWS Redshift (Data Warehouse)**

While **Athena** is a great serverless querying service for **data in S3**, **Amazon Redshift** is a **fully managed data warehouse** where you can perform high-performance SQL queries over large datasets.

You can use **Redshift Spectrum**, a feature of Amazon Redshift, to query data stored in **S3** directly from Redshift without having to move it into the warehouse first. This means you can combine the benefits of S3 storage with the performance of Redshift.

#### Key Points:

* **Data Warehouse**: Redshift is optimized for fast queries over large datasets, with massive parallel processing (MPP).
* **Integration with S3**: Redshift Spectrum allows querying S3 data from within Redshift, enabling you to combine structured data in Redshift with unstructured or semi-structured data in S3.
* **When to Use**: Use Redshift when you need advanced analytics capabilities, data warehousing features, and faster query performance on very large datasets.

### **4. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**

If your data is relational and you prefer to use traditional databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **MariaDB**, or **SQL Server**, **Amazon RDS** provides managed relational database instances.

While **Athena** is a serverless SQL query service for S3 data, you may sometimes want to store and query relational data in a managed database. **RDS** provides a fully managed service to do that.

#### Key Points:

* **Relational Databases**: Use RDS if you need a fully managed relational database for structured data (e.g., OLTP systems).
* **Integration**: You can use **AWS Glue** to load data into RDS, and then query it using SQL.

### **5. AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce)**

For more complex processing needs, **Amazon EMR** is a managed cluster platform for running **big data frameworks** like **Apache Hadoop**, **Apache Spark**, **Hive**, **Presto**, and **HBase**.

You can use **Presto** (a SQL query engine) on EMR to query large-scale data stored in S3, similar to how you use Athena, but with more control over the environment and scalability.

#### Key Points:

* **Big Data Frameworks**: Use EMR for processing large datasets using frameworks like Spark or Hadoop.
* **Presto**: You can configure Presto on EMR to run SQL queries on S3 data, similar to Athena.
* **When to Use**: Use EMR for more complex, high-performance analytics workflows or when you need custom processing beyond Athena's capabilities.

### **6. Amazon QuickSight (Visualization)**

While **Athena** allows you to query S3 data using SQL, **Amazon QuickSight** is a **business intelligence (BI)** tool that enables you to **visualize** the query results.

You can connect QuickSight to Athena, run queries, and then create interactive dashboards and visualizations. QuickSight supports a variety of chart types, and you can also use it to share insights with stakeholders.

#### Key Points:

* **Data Visualization**: QuickSight helps you create charts, graphs, and dashboards from Athena query results.
* **Integration**: You can directly connect **QuickSight** to **Athena** and visualize S3 data.
* **When to Use**: Use QuickSight for reporting and data visualization in business environments.

### **7. AWS Lambda (Serverless Computing)**

If you need to automate queries, process results, or perform transformations, you can use **AWS Lambda** in combination with Athena.

For example:

* You could trigger a Lambda function based on certain events, like new data arriving in S3.
* The Lambda function could then invoke Athena to run a query, process the result, and store the output in another location.

#### Key Points:

* **Serverless Automation**: Use Lambda to automate workflows and integrate with Athena for data processing tasks.
* **Event-driven**: Lambda can be triggered by events (e.g., file uploads to S3, time schedules, etc.).

<details>
  <summary>Click to View Detailed Explaination of Trino SQL, PySpark, and Spark SQL</summary>

### 1. **Trino SQL (Athena Query Language)**

* **Engine**: Athena is primarily built on **Trino** (formerly **Presto**), a distributed SQL query engine designed for high-performance, ad-hoc querying across large datasets. Trino supports querying data from various sources, including Amazon S3, relational databases, and NoSQL stores.
* **Query Language**: Trino uses SQL as its query language. It adheres closely to SQL standards but has some unique features tailored to distributed querying and integration with multiple data sources.
* **Performance**: Trino is optimized for large-scale, distributed SQL queries. It supports parallel query execution and can push down queries to different data sources, minimizing data transfer and speeding up queries.
* **Use Case in Athena**: When you use Athena, you’re essentially writing **Trino SQL** to query your data stored in S3. Athena does not support directly running PySpark or Spark SQL queries, but it does use Trino SQL for querying. Trino allows high flexibility in querying structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM my_table
WHERE column1 = 'some_value'
```

* This SQL query will be executed by Athena using Trino (Presto) under the hood.


### 2. **PySpark (Spark on AWS)**

* **Engine**: **PySpark** refers to the Python API for **Apache Spark**, a big data processing framework. Spark provides both batch and streaming processing capabilities and can scale horizontally. It supports distributed data processing across a cluster of machines.
* **Query Language**: In PySpark, you can interact with Spark using Python code. You can also use **Spark SQL** within PySpark, which enables SQL-like querying of data within the Spark framework.
* **Performance**: PySpark excels in scenarios where distributed data processing is required. It has a wide variety of built-in functions for data transformation, machine learning, and analytics, and it's optimized for large-scale data processing jobs. It uses the Spark engine, which is designed for big data workloads, including those requiring advanced analytics, machine learning, and graph processing.
* **Use Case in AWS**: **PySpark** can be used in various AWS services like **Amazon EMR** (Elastic MapReduce) and **AWS Glue**. While Athena does not natively support PySpark, you can still use PySpark in a custom EMR cluster to process your data and then query it with Athena or store the results back in Amazon S3.

#### Example in PySpark:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('ExampleApp').getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv('s3://my-bucket/my-data.csv')

df.filter(df['column1'] == 'some_value').select('column1', 'column2').show()
```

* This PySpark code will read data from S3, filter rows where `column1` equals `'some_value'`, and display the selected columns.


### 3. **Spark SQL (within PySpark or AWS Glue)**

* **Engine**: **Spark SQL** is the module of **Apache Spark** that provides a programming interface for working with structured and semi-structured data. Spark SQL allows you to run SQL queries on data processed by Spark and integrates with other Spark components like DataFrames and Datasets.
* **Query Language**: Spark SQL uses SQL, similar to Trino SQL. You can use SQL queries to manipulate and analyze data stored in Spark’s distributed framework.
* **Performance**: Like PySpark, Spark SQL is optimized for distributed data processing. It can scale horizontally, making it suitable for handling very large datasets. However, it is often considered slower than Trino for pure querying workloads because Spark is more focused on distributed data transformation and processing, while Trino is designed for querying across distributed data sources.
* **Use Case in AWS**: Spark SQL can be used in **Amazon EMR**, **AWS Glue**, and **Amazon Redshift Spectrum**. If you're using Spark SQL in EMR or Glue, you can query large datasets from S3, transform them, and store the results back in S3 or another data lake.

#### Example in Spark SQL:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM my_table
WHERE column1 = 'some_value'
```

* This SQL query can be executed within a Spark cluster on EMR or in Spark SQL integrated environments.
