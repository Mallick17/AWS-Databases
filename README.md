# **Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)**
## **What is Big Data?**

**Big Data** refers to datasets that are **too large or complex** for traditional data processing systems (like MySQL, Excel, or PostgreSQL) to handle efficiently.

Big Data is typically described by the **3 V's**:

1. **Volume** – Huge amounts of data (terabytes to petabytes)
2. **Velocity** – Data is generated quickly (e.g., real-time sensor or log data)
3. **Variety** – Data comes in many formats (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

> Examples:
>
> * Web server logs from millions of users
> * Social media feeds
> * IoT sensor data
> * Clickstream tracking

## **What is Amazon EMR?**

**Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)** is a **cloud-based big data platform** that lets you **process, transform, and analyze large volumes of data** using open-source tools like **Hadoop**, **Spark**, **Hive**, **Flink**, etc.

> 🎯 **Think of EMR as your Big Data factory**: AWS spins up a cluster of EC2 machines, installs your tools (like Spark), configures them, and allows them to work together to process massive datasets.

4. Aggregate and summarize the data
5. Store the final dataset back to S3 or Redshift

## **What is Amazon Glue (vs EMR)?**

**AWS Glue** is a **fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** service for **data preparation** and **metadata cataloging**. It is **not for big data processing in distributed clusters** like EMR, but it’s often used **before EMR or Redshift**.

| Feature       | Amazon Glue                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type          | Serverless Data Integration & Cataloging                      |
| Primary Use   | ETL jobs: move and transform data                             |
| Engines       | Python/Spark-based                                            |
| Data Storage  | Reads/Writes to S3, Redshift, JDBC                            |
| Bonus Feature | **Glue Crawlers** automatically catalog data and infer schema |

---

### **What Are Glue Crawlers?**

A **Glue Crawler** scans data (in S3, RDS, etc.), infers its schema, and creates metadata tables in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.

> 🔍 Example:
>
> * You have CSV files in S3 → crawler identifies columns/types → makes a table you can query with **Athena** or **Redshift Spectrum**.

## 📎 Summary Notes

* **Amazon EMR**: Best for **big data processing**, **machine learning**, and **batch analytics** using **open-source frameworks**.
* **Amazon Redshift**: Best for **running analytical SQL queries** on large, structured datasets.
* **Amazon Glue**: Best for **data integration**, **transformation**, and **cataloging** — often used **before Redshift or EMR**.
* **Amazon RDS**: Best for **OLTP** (Online Transaction Processing), where your app needs real-time, structured data updates.
